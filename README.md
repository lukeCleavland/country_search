## How to use

To start the server open a terminal window on unix/linux based systems and change
directory to the project root. Then execute this command:

```
  ./server
```

The command assumes you have a PHP binary in your system path. If you don't you
will get an error and the server will not start.

After starting the server go to:

```
http://localhost:8765/index.html  
```
